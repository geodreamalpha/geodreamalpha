Instructions for building Unity:

1) go to file and click on build settings.

2) make sure the right Unity Scene is in "scenes to build".  By default, it may not include any scenes
and therefore you may not be able to run the build.

3) make sure the target platform is appropriate.  Most of you will be using windows I imagine.  By default, it displays windows x86 and that should be fine for now even though it is the 32 bit version.  I believe Nick was able to successfully build it on his mac laptop

4) When building the final product, or honestly, when building for the latter part of this project, we will need to consider "quality settings".  You can get there by navigating up to the tab "edit", then "prject settings".  A window should pop up.  In that window, go to quality.  This is where we can adjust how much processing will be used in a build,  Which is useful if we're going to run this on say, a school computer or a laptop.

5) go back to the build settings and ou will see two options: build and build and run.  Build just puts the executable in a directory that you specify.  You will need to click on it and the game should play.  Build and Run will just play the game automatically after the build process is complete.
