Instructions for building Unity:

The process of building Unity in developer mode is short.  All the dependencies needed from firebase and other asset libraries are already baked in.  
Once you install a local copy of Unity from the main branch and load up the corresponding Unity project, everything will load/ download along with 
the Unity editor itself.

Process to build and run the game from the Unity Editor:

1) In build settings, you will see two options: "build" and "build and run".  "Build" places the executable in a directory that you specify.  
You will need to click on it and the game should execute.  "Build and Run" will execute the game automatically after the build process is 
complete.

2) The firebase login page will load.  Create an account (if you are a new user) and login.

3) the seed menu will load.  In the input box (top box), type in the seed you would like.  For example: "0_0".

4) the GameScene will load and you will be able to play the game.


These are some things to consider when troubleshooting:

1) go to file and click on build settings.

2) make sure the right Unity Scene is in "scenes to build".  By default, it may not include any scenes
and therefore you may not be able to run the build.  

3) make sure the target platform is appropriate.  Most of you will be using windows I imagine.  
By default, it displays windows x86 and that should be fine for now even though it is the 32 bit version.  
I believe Nick was able to successfully build it on his mac laptop

4) When building the final product, we will need to consider "quality settings".  
You can get there by navigating up to the tab "edit", then "prject settings".  A window should pop up.  In that window, go to quality.  
This is where we can adjust how much processing will be used in a build,  Which is useful if we're going to run this on say, a school computer or a laptop.
