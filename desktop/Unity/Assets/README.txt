Since Unity uses the Assets folder for C# scripts and other assets, 
I think it makes sense to create our folders for each of the different 
Unity components we will be working on in this directory. -Tyler Anderson

make sure to create a namespace to put your empty, public class in.
the namespace will right above your class declaration.  You can
follow the example I have in my c# scripts.  For example, one of my
namespaces is "TerrainGeneratorComponent" and its public class is "TerrainGenerator".
Name your namespace and class appropriate to its function.

Don't forget to leave your name in a comment at the top of the class.
To add a comment line, preface the line with "\\".
