Installation version:
Unity 2021.1.21f1 (latest version of Unity as of recently)

Installation page for Unity:
Go to this link:

https://unity3d.com/get-unity/update

1) from the above link, install Unity Hub if you have not already downloaded it.
2) after installing Unity Hub, click "Install Version from Unity Hub" which should be located
on the same webpage.  It may take a few moments but unity hub will open.  Follow the installation
instructions.  You shouldn't need to change any of the default settings for
windows 10.  But just in case, make sure your IDE is "Visual Studio" and more importantly, you have "windows build
support" selected.  These things may not be checked automatically if you are a mac user.
You may need to explicitely check "windows build support" in that case.  In addition, Unity should allow you
to make a windows build support game on a mac without issue.
NOTE: if you do not have visual studio, unity should guide you through that installation process as well.  But if not, 
here is the link to download the visual studio IDE:

https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/

Install the above link if Unity did not install visual studio for you.  Make sure to download "visual studio" 
(not "visual studio code").  You will want to download the latest "community" version.  Its the free version.  It will
prompt you to download the visual studio installer.  From the installer, you should be able to download visual studio community.  As of this data, the latest version shold be visual studio 2019.  It should be compatible with the latest version of Unity.

Naming Conventions for Unity:
we are using "pascal case" (upper camel case) for types (classes, structs, enums) and methods, and "lower camal case" for fields and properties, for example:
Type (classes, structs, enums) and Method examples: DataSystemLibrary, GetDataAs, SetDataAs
field and property examples: playerPositionX, getWorldPosition

Here is a link to help explain this:
