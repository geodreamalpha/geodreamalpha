    <string name="about_text">GeoDream Alpha is an action-RPG available now on your desktop PC!\n
        \n
        Fight challenging enemies, gain experience, and level up alongside your companion, as you
        fight to survive for as long as possible. Once you\'ve made an account on the desktop game,
        come back here to log-in, after which you can start leveling up your companion character to
        make them stronger! There is no way to level up your companion in the desktop game, so make
        sure you come back to train them here!\n
        \n
        GeoDream Alpha (Desktop Game) is currently available on [Steam].
